# Front End Test

This test is meant to demonstrate Germ√°n Pardo's experience with React and hooks.

As requested, the entire project is in one page and it's meant to showcase a CRUD regarding Users.

The libraries used are:

- Sass: More scalable and clean css.
- React Query: A library of hooks that gives projects an opinonated way to fetch and transform data.
- React DatePicker: A library that consists on a date picker component already made and ready for react.
- Formik: A simple and efficient library for form management.

All the files are in lowercase to add consistency to the project, also does not confuse the file system in certain versions of Windows in case they need to be used.

The env.ts file is suposed to be in the .gitignore, however, it's left there so it's easier to change for those who grade the test.

Mappers are used to show the decoupling between the front-end and the back-end.
